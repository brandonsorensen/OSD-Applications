# Make Class Choice File

### PowerSchool Credentials

This program interfaces with PowerSchool, and to do that we need to have specific ID and passcode. You will recieve a JSON file called `powerschool-credentials.json` that contains the credentials. The program cannot run without this file. 

## Running the Script

Running the script is rather straightforward. There are a few steps that differ depending on your platform:

- Windows

  - You must double click the `make_classchoice.py` file. If you do not see a file with the `.py` extension, look at the "Type" column in the file explorer. You want the one that says "Python file".

- macOS

  - You want to click the `make_classchoice` file with no extension. Its icon should look like this:
    ![Executable Icon](../images/exec-icon.png)

     This will open a Terminal window.

- Type the term ID for for the sections you want to create new sections for.
